## Explaining the tags

So in this topic I will explaining what the tags do and why I used they on  my project:

First of all, this is a simple explanions of the tags functions and problably are not 100% correct.

  **HTML TAGS**
  - The tag <p> was used to made all the paragraphs;
  - The tag <body> is where i put all the content and tags that user will see
  - The tag <img> was used to put images on the site.
  - The tag <audio> was used to put audio on the site.
  - The tag <title> is used to put a Title on the page name
  - The tag <br> is used to make a line break (new line)
  - The tag <video> is used to put a Video on the site.
  - The tag <link> is used to reference the Style Sheet.
  - The tag <div> is the mos important tag here, thanks to her we can defines the width, padding, margin,        and everything else of the content area.

Now lets talk about the:
  **CSS TAGS**
  - Selector {Body} is used to make all the changes on the pages body, on my website I put some background       image and set to not repeat.
  - Class {CENTER} I used this class to center all the tags off the html and make some edition on the <p>        tag, the most important is Color to change the color text and the Text-Allign that is used to center.
  - Class {HEADER} I used to make header for the page, put some backgroung-color, border and etc..
